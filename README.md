This is a collection of solutions to selected exercises from "A Primer on Scientific Computing with Python" by Hans Langtangen, Fourth Edition.
Despite the title and its assumptions of minimal prerequisites, this book is quite comprehensive (over 600 pages of main material and another 300 in appendices)!
It is particularly well-suited as a programming self-learning tool for someone coming from a mathematics or science background .

The goal of this project is to provide solutions to enough of the exercises (at least half from each chapter) to cover each topic and technique thoroughly.
I do not feel it is necessary to do single one, as there is a fair amount of repetition of similar exercises - it's all about maximizing the learning-to-effort ratio!

The purpose is to both document my own experience in learning Python, as well as to provide a reference for someone else who is learning.
If you find mistakes or have suggestions, or would simply like to discuss Python, please contact me at weiyun(dot)lu(at)gmail(dot)com.
